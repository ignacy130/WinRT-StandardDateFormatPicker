# WinRT-StandardDateFormatPicker
Simple control based on ComboBoxes to pick date in common in Europe and most of the world format dd-mm-yyyy.
Now solution contains whole example app - sorry.

## To-do
- remove app enviroment and leave control only
- add MinYear, MaxYear and MinDay support
- add date ranges support
- create nuget package

Any help, solutions and commits are highly appreciated! ;)
